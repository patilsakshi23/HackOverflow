Calmify: A Stress Reduction Space

Introduction
Calmify is a Python-based web application designed to evaluate stress levels by analyzing multiple input formats such as video, text, audio, and quiz responses. The system uses advanced machine learning techniques to assess user data and provides personalized recommendations for stress reduction activities. This innovative solution aims to promote mental well-being by suggesting appropriate interventions, including yoga, music, and mindfulness exercises.

Technologies Used

Frontend: React (with styled-components for improved UI design)

Backend: Django (to handle requests and manage data processing)

Machine Learning Models:

CNN (Convolutional Neural Network): Used for facial landmark detection in video input.

RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): Used for text analysis to detect stress and emotional states.

NLP Techniques: Employed for text tokenization, padding, and sequence prediction.

Dataset
The DAIC-WOZ dataset was used for training the model. This dataset contains conversation-based text with associated labels indicating stress and emotional states. It is ideal for training models in detecting mental health patterns.

System Workflow

Homepage and Navigation:

The landing page displays a smooth text-writing animation introducing "Calmify."

After the animation, users can select one of the three options: Video, Audio, or Text input.

Video Analysis Module:

Users can either upload a video or capture one using their device camera.

A CNN model processes the video to analyze facial landmarks and micro-expressions, which are used to assess stress levels.

Audio Analysis Module:

Users can upload an audio file or record their voice directly.

The system processes audio features such as pitch, tone, and rhythm to identify stress patterns.

Text Analysis Module:

Users input text into a textarea.

The text data is processed using an RNN-LSTM model trained with the DAIC-WOZ dataset.

Tokenization and padding techniques are applied to format text inputs before feeding them into the model for accurate prediction.

Prediction and Recommendations:

The system classifies the data as either "Stress" or "No Stress."

If stress is detected, Calmify provides personalized recommendations, including:

Music for relaxation

Yoga and breathing exercises

Interactive games for mental relief

Model Architecture and Key Functions

Text Analysis Model Architecture:

Embedding Layer: Converts text data into dense vector representations.

LSTM Layers: Used to capture long-term dependencies and contextual meaning.

Dense Layer: Classifies data as "Stress" or "No Stress."

Video Analysis Model Architecture:

Convolutional Layers: Extracts key facial features from video frames.

Pooling Layers: Reduces dimensionality while retaining crucial features.

Fully Connected Layer: Provides final stress prediction.

Key Functions in Python Implementation:

load_model(): Loads the trained model for inference.

tokenize_input(): Preprocesses text data before prediction.

predict_stress(): Utilizes the trained model to classify stress or no stress.

recommend_activities(): Suggests relaxation activities based on the user's detected emotional state.

Conclusion
Calmify effectively integrates machine learning models with a user-friendly interface to analyze stress levels across different input types. By leveraging CNN, RNN-LSTM, and NLP techniques, Calmify delivers personalized recommendations, empowering users to manage their mental well-being efficiently. This innovative solution offers a comprehensive stress detection system that aligns with modern technology trends, supporting mental health awareness and self-care practices.
